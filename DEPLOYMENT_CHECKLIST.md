## Troubleshooting Resources

### If Backend Fails:
1. Check Render logs
2. Verify MongoDB connection
3. Check environment variables
4. Test health endpoint

### If Frontend Fails:
1. Check build logs on Render
2. Verify VITE_API_URL is correct
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check console for errors

### If API Calls Fail:
1. Verify backend is running
2. Check CORS settings
3. Verify API URL in frontend
4. Check network tab in browser
